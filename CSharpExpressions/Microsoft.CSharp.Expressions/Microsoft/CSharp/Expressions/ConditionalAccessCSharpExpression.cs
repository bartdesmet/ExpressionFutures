        //         for example in a visitor. Its use is limited to manually created conditional access expressions using
        //         specialized factories, although we could make the general-purpose factory instantiate a generic based on
        //         the access node type. It may have to check for valid uses anyway, so it could know what the access type
        //         is. Note that the code emitted by the Roslyn compiler will bind to the generic factory.
        //
        //         However, the typing benefit of this node is rather shallow given that the access expression could be
        //         more than just a single operation. It'd only capture the node type of the last operation. As such, it's
        //         only useful when users construct an explicit left-associative series of conditional access expressions,
        //         such that each access expression only involves a single operation, e.g.
        //
        //           ((x?.Foo)?.Bar(qux))?[baz]
        //               ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^
        //              Member   Call     Index
        //
        //         When the right-associative nature of the conditional access expression is used, access expressions can
        //         be arbitrarily complex, so the strong typing of the access expression is shallow, e.g.
        //
        //           x?.Foo.Bar(qux)?[baz].Corge()

        //         As such, we may just want to do away with this typing. We could still keep some of the factory methods

            //       effectively capture a superset of the possibilities provided by the C# language for the construct. E.g.
            //       you could construct a null-conditional call where the conditional receiver is used for a parameter that's
            //       different from the receiving instance (or the `this` parameter for an extension method):
            //
            //         ConditionalAccess(bar, receiver, Call(foo, qux, { receiver }))  ==  foo.qux(bar) iff bar != null

            //
            //       We could decide the cost of checking doesn't yield enough benefits given that it only applies to hand-
            //       crafted expressions (i.e. the compiler will never emit a non-standard form). We'd still have to support
            //       this behavior in future versions and consider it to have well-defined behavior, or document it as having
            //       undefined behavior (with little predecents) from the get-go.
            //
            //       Finally, note that we could do away with this problem by modeling the nodes differently without relying on
            //       a node for the conditional receiver. To do so, we'd have to introduce expressions for argument lists that
            //       don't include the receiver, which duplicates a lot of existing LINQ nodes. In such a design, the receiver
            //       would be implicit and always correspond to the "left-most source" in the access expression. It comes at
            //       the cost of not being able to reuse existing LINQ nodes which always have a bound receiver, but we could
            //       piggyback on the work to introduce C#-specific nodes for e.g. ParameterAssignment to create nodes for e.g.
            //       argument lists. Old LINQ nodes could be considered applications of more primitive partial nodes:
            //
            //         Call(o, m, args)   ==  Access(o, Call(m, args))   ==  o.m(args)
            //         Member(o, p)       ==  Access(o, Member(p))       ==  o.p
            //         Index(o, i, args)  ==  Access(o, Index(i, args))  ==  o.i[args]
            //         Invoke(f, args)    ==  Access(f, Invoke(args))    ==  o(args)
            //
            //       In this setting, we could still allow further composition of the access expressions by passing a list of
            //       access operations in lieu of the second operand to `Access`, e.g.
            //
            //                    Access(o, { Member(p), Call(m, args2) })  ==  o.p.m(args2)
            //
            //       Substituting `Access` for `ConditionalAccess` would mean the following:
            //
            //         ConditionalAccess(o, { Member(p), Call(m, args2) })  ==  o?.p.m(args2)
            //
            //       Note that it makes for a much stranger tree representation (though arguably the current form is weird too)
            //       with new partially applied `Member`, `Call`, `Index`, and `Invoke` constructs. Instead, we could nest them
            //       as well, by only having one (inner-most, left-most) access-unbound node in the access expression:
            //
            //         ConditionalAccess(o, Call(Member(   p), m, args2))

            //       With this form, the check is still expensive, because we need to check for exactly one unbound form in the
