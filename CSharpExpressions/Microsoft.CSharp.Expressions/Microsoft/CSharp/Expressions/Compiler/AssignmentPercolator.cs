    /// Utility to percolate assignments down to the last innermost expression within blocks.
    /// This step is used to push down the assignment of an asynchronous lambda body's result to a local variable.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// During async lambda rewriting, we turn the body of the lambda into a try {} catch {} statement in order
    /// to catch any exceptions and set them on the resulting task. To assign the successful result of evaluating
    /// the body to the task, we introduce a local variable and perform a top-level assignment of the rewritten
    /// body expression to that local. This leads to an assignment whose rhs can contain jump targets introduced
    /// by the rewrite to the async state machine. In order to make such jumps valid, we push down the assignment
    /// to the result variable.
    /// 
    /// For example, consider the following async lambda body:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///   A
    ///   await T;
    ///   B
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// This turns into a state machine roughly similar to:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///   switch (__state)
    ///   {
    ///     case 1:
    ///       goto L1;
    ///       break;
    ///     case 2:
    ///       goto L2;
    ///       break;
    ///   }
    /// 
    ///   body;
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// where the body corresponds to:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///   L1:
    ///     A
    ///     __awaiter = T.GetAwaiter();
    ///     if (!__awaiter.IsCompleted)
    ///     {
    ///        __state = 2;
    ///        __awaiter.OnCompleted(resume);
    ///        goto __exit;
    ///     }
    /// 
    ///   L2:
    ///     __awaiter.GetResult();
    ///     B
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// where __state and __awaiter are hoisted variables. Assume that B's return type is non-void, therefore requiring
    /// us to save the result in order to set it on the resulting Task via the method builder. We do so by introducing
    /// a simple top-level assignment:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///   __result = body
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// However, because the body contains jump targets used by the state machine's dispatch table, we have to percolate
    /// down assignments. This causes the body to be rewritten to:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///   L1:
    ///     ...
    ///   L2:
    ///     ...
    ///     __result = B
    /// </code>
    /// 
    /// Note that B may be a non-void label expression with a default value itself. The case is covered separately via
    /// the TypedLabelRewriter.

                            //     a less derived type because of the LHS of the assignment being less
                            //     derived, Update methods for the nodes above us, such as Block, will
                            //     complain. So we convert the entire assignment to its RHS type if the
                            //     types don't match. An example is shown below:
                            //
                            //       Base b = await (Derived)x;
                            //
                            //     We know this is safe to do because a plain assignment can only be an
                            //     assignment where the RHS is reference assignable to the LHS (so not
                            //     even a boxing conversion is allowed), hence there will be no side-
                            //     effects due to user-defined conversions or so. We also know it can't
                            //     fail because the RHS is not changing typing.
                            //
                            //     Note this could be avoided if we know that we can change all nodes
                            //     encountered in percolation to void types. However, the expression
                            //     API lacks "statement expression" nodes which clearly indicate such
                            //     an intent, so detecting these "as void" nodes is a bit cumbersome.
                            //
                            //     Also note that our percolator doesn't distinguish between (reduced)
                            //     await nodes and other nodes, so we can't assume we'd only be changing
                            //     the type of assignment caused by await. While it's invalid to write
                            //     the following in C# today, it is possible in the expression API:
                            //
                            //       /*Base*/ b = { A; B; (Derived)x; }; // an expression block
                            //
                            //     If we percolate the assignment here, the type of the block changes
                            //     which can have implications to the type checking of parent nodes. So
                            //     our percolation can also make otherwise invalid "jump into expression"
                            //     cases that are rejected by the lambda compiler become valid given
                            //     that we push down assignments for these as well.
                            //
