    // NB: The tests cross-check the outcome of evaluating a lambda expression - specified as a string in the
    //     test cases - in two ways. First, by converting the lambda expression to a delegate type and running
    //     IL code produced by the compiler. Second, by converting the lambda expression to an expression tree
    //     using the extended expression tree support in our modified Roslyn build and compiling the expression
    //     at runtime (therefore invoking our Reduce methods).
    //
    //     It is assumed that the outcome has proper equality defined (i.e. EqualityComparer<T>.Default should
    //     return a meaningful equality comparer to assert evaluation outcomes against each other). If the
    //     evaluation results in an exception, its type is cross-checked.
    //
    //     In addition to cross-checking the evaluation outcome, a log is maintained and cross-checked, which
    //     is useful to assert the order of side-effects. The code fragments can write to this log by means of
    //     the Log method and the Return method (to prepend returning a value of type T with a logging side-
    //     effect).
